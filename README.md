# Project for the nasa space app challenge 2024
Our project focuses on creating an interactive solar system simulation utilizing JavaScript and the X3DOM library for 3D visualization. This simulation effectively models celestial bodies, including planets, moons, and asteroids, to provide an engaging educational tool for understanding orbital mechanics and the dynamics of the solar system. By allowing users to adjust simulation parameters such as speed and toggle visibility for orbits and labels, the project enhances user interaction and comprehension of complex astronomical concepts. A notable achievement of our project is the incorporation of precise calculations for celestial positions based on orbital parameters, enabling accurate and visually appealing representations of planetary movements. The simulation not only demonstrates the beauty of space but also serves as an accessible platform for fostering interest in science and space exploration through visualization and interactivity.
